 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Though low-cost generic drugs exist, almost one half of child deaths occur are from four preventable and treatable diseases. In low-income countries, access to essential medicines remains obstructed for many of the children that are most desperate for treatment. The emerging field of social enterprise offers innovative models for global health delivery through a combination of business acumen and social responsibility.  OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to investigate the impact of one of these social enterprise models: the HealthStore Foundation's CFWShop franchise network in Kenya.  METHODS: Household survey data was collected from the national Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) dataset which included information on health-seeking behaviors, reported child illnesses, basic demographic and GPS information. Operational data regarding CFWShops, including GPS clinic locations, were collected from the HealthStore Foundation. Several series of regressions were then utilized to determine significant association between CFWShop catchment area and outcomes of interest including: type of health facility visited, receipt of various medical treatments, and vaccination history.  RESULTS: The study found a significant association between CFWShop catchment area and vaccination status and receipt of treatments. Living in a 30km catchment area was associated with an average 1.429 more vaccinations received, with a 1.558 OR (p\textless.01) of receiving a BCG vaccination and a 1.341 OR (p\textless.01) of receiving a measles vaccination. Catchment area was not associated with a difference in type of health facility visited, though it was associated with a 1.487 OR (p\textless.01) of receiving medical treatment for children reporting fever, diarrhea or cough.  CONCLUSION: Overall, there is substantial evidence that living within 30km of a CFWShop is associated with increased likelihood of obtaining essential medicines, regardless of income status. Ultimately more studies need to be done to understand the causal effects of new innovative delivery models and to determine best practices to improve access to essential medicines in low-income settings.},

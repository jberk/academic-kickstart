abstract: "Needs and Objectives: Content: To create a foundation of 50 online clinical teaching summaries on a wiki platform Collaboration: To empower authors to contribute summaries from textgreater 10 institutions Impact: To have over 5, 000 site views within 6 months of completion of The Core 50 Setting and Participants: The Free Open-Access Medical Education (FOAM) movement is a growing online community that utilizes social media for medical education1-6 Existing literature has shown that social media can be a useful tool within the medical curriculum if implemented correctly7 and an estimated 98% of residents use some type of social media for education every week.8 Our gap assessment revealed the need for a platform that warehouses available education resources that facilitate resident-led ambulatory care \"chalk talks, \"is widely accessible and searchable, allows users to comment on resource quality, and embraces contributions of all those interested in medical education. Every week, at every institution, residents spend hours synthesizing material and creating their own teaching plans without a means to share their efforts. Description: Clinic Wiki offers a platform for residents to create succinct clinical summaries to assist resident learning. As an open-source wiki, users across the world will continually update and improve pages on primary care topics. In this way, it harbors the power of collaboration and knowledge-sharing to create a portal for outpatient resident education. Each page will have clinical pearls, teaching scripts, clinical trial summaries, links to learn more, and ways to share content and other social media material. Each page will correspond to a specific clinical topic and each institution will select a resident curator and faculty mentor for each page it will \"own.\" The wiki will also have a means to share curriculum developed by users and other forms of resources such as podcasts where users can comment and vote on which resources they feel are most valuable for medical education. Initial partners include Johns Hopkins, Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham and Women, Yale, Colorado, and Oregon Health System University. The initial partners will create \"The Core 50\"-A collection of 50 outpatient topics that every primary care provider should have a strong knowledge to teach and practice. Evaluation: The evaluation of the wiki is based on resident utilization of the platform. Success will be measured by unique users, user visits, and total contributions. Each page has a crowd-sourced grading system to determine which pages are most helpful. Random user surveys will offer more compre-hensive feedback mechanisms to provide continuous data for quality improvement iterations. Discussion/Reflection/Lessons Learned: Initial lessons have included the importance of maximizing simplicity for the end-user. To do so requires advanced knowledge of social media platforms, which can create a major barrier to entry. Contributingto a wiki page is only easy if the foundation allows for a friendly end-user experience, which can be difficult to create. Online Resource URL (Optional): www.clinicwiki.org."
